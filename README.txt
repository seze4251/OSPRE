Hello All,

This is current working directory of the OSPRE sensor package code. The script makeAll.sh updates/makes a new OSPRE build. To clean the .o files, type ‘make clean’ in the OSPRE directory.  The script runAll.sh runs all the OSPRE processes. The include directory has all the header files.  The src directory has all the src files.  The organization of this will likely change when the Navigation and Image Processing Sub Systems get all their code integrated into the system. 

Enjoy!
